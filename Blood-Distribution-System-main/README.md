# Blood Disribution System
A Project for managing blood supply and demand, and make an efficient distribution system.

Connect hospitals and blood banks.
So they will know where is the nearest bank with required blood type and number of units present.
They can also know about the dononrs phone number and blood type so that they can call the person in hospital for giving blood.

In worst cases like attacks of 26/11 banks will be able to arrange blood quickly for the hospitals.

Blood loan can take place.
Borrow blood against some collateral and pay later.

Thank you message will be sent to donor when their blood gets used.
And after every 3 months reminder for blood donation.
"take care" messages so our donors stay healthy and keep donating.
